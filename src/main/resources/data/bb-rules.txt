Burger Battle is a card game of strategy & sabotage. Your goal is to be the first to build your burger, but watch out! Other players will do whatever it takes to build their burger first. Adding ingredients, taking them away, blowing them up or even sacrificing their own burger to take you down!

== HOW TO PLAY
Players will receive 1 of 8 different Burgers, each with different ingredients. To win, you must build your Burger to completion while keeping other players from building theirs.

During your turn, you will play an ingredient for your Burger and draw a card; This repeats until you can no longer play. Once your turn is finished, you can either discard a card or play a Battle Card.

Battle Cards add and take away ingredients, protect your Burger or blow other players' Burgers up. Some can be as simple as switching hands others can be as devastating as destroying all the Burgers on the table, including yours.
